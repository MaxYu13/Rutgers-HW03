# Rutgers-HW03

1. Created arrays filled with the characters that may be used for the password generation
2. Wrote the writePassword function that will use a series of prompts and confirms to define the parameters the user wants for their password.
3. Wrote several booleans and while loops to confirm that length is a num between 8-128 and that the user chose at least one type of character for their password.
